            <h2 class="mb-5">Competence</h2>
            <h4 class="competence-title">DLR 1. The professional bachelor TI analyzes a problem, translates it into an IT context and presents the information needs of an organization in a structured way by using analysis and modeling techniques.</h4>
            <p>In our education we very often have to solve IT-related problems. These problems were modeled in the Data Modeling Techniques course</p>
            <br>

            <h4 class="competence-title">DLR 2. The professional bachelor TI collects and processes process and data, stores them and makes them available so that they can be retrieved in a correct and efficient manner.</h4>
            <p>In the BPM course we learned how to process data and how to put the data into a database and retrieve it by means of data queries.</p>
            <br>

            <h4 class="competence-title">DLR 3. The professional bachelor TI designs, builds, documents and tests qualitative IT solutions.</h4>
            <p>We learned designing, building and testing at web design. We did both front-end and back-end and also had to test the codes through automatic tests</p>
            <br>

            <h4 class="competence-title">DLR 4. The professional bachelor TI installs, configures, secures, maintains and supports IT solutions and adapts them if necessary so that they continue to meet the changing needs of an organization.</h4>
            <p>These competencies were mainly applied in the Computer Networks course, we learned how to configure and secure systems, but also to make adjustments or add elements afterwards.</p>
            <br>

            <h4 class="competence-title">DLR 5. The professional bachelor TI acts ethically and socially responsible, in accordance with the business and organizational context, best practices and strategies based on his own insight and knowledge.</h4>
            <p>We haven't dealt with this competency yet in the study, so I don't know if I already have this competency or should still be working on it.</p>
            <br>

            <h4 class="competence-title">DLR 6. The professional bachelor TI examines and critically evaluates existing and innovative IT solutions.</h4>
            <p>For most subjects, not everything is explained in the course, so you are expected to look up yourself on google or other sources. If I have found a possible solution, I will check whether there is not a better and more efficient way and whether it actually does what is expected.</p>
            <br>

            <h4 class="competence-title">DLR 7. The professional bachelor TI provides advice on IT solutions, products, services and technologies for different domains and/or sectors.</h4>
            <p>In the BPM and web design courses, we always ask who the "customer" is, and we have to adapt things to the customer according to the situation.</p>
            <br>

            <h4 class="competence-title">DLR 8. The professional bachelor TI can tackle an assignment independently and in a multidisciplinary and/or multicultural team. The professional bachelor TI can easily perform managerial tasks and design, interpret, implement, adapt and explain a project plan.</h4>
            <p>In many subjects we sometimes have to work together in groups, this has ensured that I know how we should and can work together, and how you can divide or hand out tasks. In the web design course we had to make a group task, but we completed individual assignments.</p>
            <br>

            <h4 class="competence-title">DLR 9. The professional bachelor TI communicates at least in Dutch and English, orally and in writing, adapted to the target audience.</h4>
            <p>We have study materials in English where you are expected to understand English. There are also tasks that are done in English, such as with the communication assignment, I have chosen to make my E-Portfolio and CV in English.</p>
            <br>

            <h4 class="competence-title">DLR 10. The professional bachelor TI is aware of the international context of the field.</h4>
            <p>IT is everywhere and an IT-guy will be needed everywhere all over the world. There is also often communication with foreign countries which is mostly in English.</p>
            <br>

            <h4 class="competence-title">DLR 11. The professional bachelor TI is entrepreneurial, takes initiative and responds to new developments and application domains.</h4>
            <p>The IT world will never stand still and will always continue to evolve, which also means that you have to learn new things and adapt yourself. Looking up new things and learning new things myself helps me to be able to apply those adjustments.</p>

            <h4 class="competence-title">DLR 12. The professional bachelor TI supports change processes when IT solutions are put into use.</h4>
            <p>I am always ready to make changes or adjust things. For example, in the scripting languages course we were given exercises that had to be adjusted later, or that we had to make adjustments ourselves because things had to be different or things had changed.</p>
